### Course Objectives

Prerequsites: previous coursework in the humanities; no or very little programming experience preferred

In the data, information, knowledge, wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy that circulates through Knowledge Management (KM) and Information Science (IS) discussions, data appears at the base of a pyramid of which wisdom is the pinnacle. In this schematic, data is “raw” and lacking in meaning, while information, the next higher level of the pyramid—just below knowledge and then wisdom—represents the presence of added links and relationships; information is higher up on the wisdom chain because it is data made meaningful. In the humanities, students are taught that data is not found in the “raw” but has rather been cooked all along, taken and constructed and seasoned according to our situated contexts including access issues (Where is the data?); media, format, and technology constraints (How is the data?); and perspectives (What is the data? Who is involved in and impacted by its creation and use?).

Learning to think critically about data as information means rejecting common illusions about data more generally, including its objectivity, impersonality, atemporality, and authorlessness. To teach students to think about information from this more critical perspective means first understanding how a culture tends to understand what is informative.

Towards these ends, this course takes on “data wrangling” in the context of humanist perspectives.

Learning goals:

-  Exploration of cultural implications of large-scale preservation of cultural materials.

-  Writing using perspectives in critical data studies;

-  Familiarity with scripting-style programming in Python and Unix-like systems, emphasizing literacy in finding and using free and open source software; techniques for collecting, transforming, and analyzing media and metadata available on the Web; with commonly used data models and their standard formats, including CSV, JSON, and XML; with text analysis techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and machine learning classification; and with tools for analyzing cultural data via visualization and statistical tests, emphasizing critical reflection on the limitations of these approaches.

### Course Principles

-  Writing critically about data requires both a level of knowldege about data and data wrangling as it requires a level of knowledge about thinking and writing from critical perspectives learned in cultural studies. While this course does not *teach* cultural studies, an understanding of and experience in humanities theory and research and the principles of cultural studies are essential.

-  Imitating and modifying others’ code is essential in learning to program. You can many examples and explanations on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and similar online forums. Taking one or two lines without attribution is OK; if you use a longer chunk of code found online, add a #comment with the source’s URL.

-   Begin assignments early. If you realize what you had in mind is more difficult than expected, talk to the instructor about choosing an alternative.

-   We’ll be focusing on a scripting approach to programming. This course is not oriented toward developing large, complex programs or writing perfectly optimized code.

-   Learning to code takes trial and error. Work through weekly programming tutorials before class and continue polishing in-class coding assignments at home.

## Assignments

### Final Project: Critical Data Analysis (50%)

For your final project, you will use a dataset drawn from online sources and analyze those data in a critical essay. You may either present an argument about the data (e.g., describing bias in the way the data were chosen and arranged) or you may use your dataset as the basis for an argument about culture (e.g., tracing a stylistic shift in a literary community). You should conceive and execute your project with a specific audience in mind, such as literary scholars, newspaper readers, or policy advocates.

Your dataset should comprise at least 200 texts or other media files, or at least 2000 metadata records. The size of your collection should be appropriate to your technical skills and the complexity of each record. Rather than using an entire pre-existing dataset, you may choose to extend or limit the dataset in some way. This might mean curating material from multiple sources, mashing up two or more datasets, augmenting records using machine learning or natural language processing, or using a creative technique to organize messy data.

Your final project will include the following elements:

-   Proposal (7%)

-   Proposal Peer Review (3%)

-   In-class presentation (week 14) (10%)

-   10 page critical essay, with an appendix of 3–4 data visualizations (30%)

### Weekly Assignments (WA) (50%)

Except when indicated, there will be required readings each week. The required readings will either be available online and linked below or posted on Canvas, so there are no books to buy or papers to acquire for the class.

Assignments should be posted on Canvas by midnight the day before class.
