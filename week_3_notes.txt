# PCDA week 3 plans


## Let’s go around for a minute and talk a bit about our computers.

Where’d you get your laptop, how old is it?

 - or -

Tell us about your first computer.

## I'm here to help you do things you find interesting.

I'm a hands-on guide, an advice-giver, someone who wants to fill in the practical gaps that other classes are missing.

Part of hacker culture is the lore — what’s been done, who’s famous. Like graffiti artists or any other culture.

You all have your own kinda subcultures,

### Question

Has anyone done work in



### Demo

Demo: using an API to grab some JSON records.

## Slow walkthrough

- Transferring (w/ filtering) from one list to another with a for loop.

- List comprehensions — doing it in 1 line, very Pythonic

- Pick an API from a list and start exploring the tree to find a given field. Make a list of titles/urls/etc.


### List of APIs:

- V&A Museum
- Crossref
- Google Search


## Dictionaries

- A given key can point to numbers, text strings, lists, dictionaries, whatever.

- Point: Dictionaries and JSON objects are basically the same thing.

- Make a list of PDFs linked on a page and download them all, pausing between each.


## Break

## Reformatting dates
    - notebook in copy_me/ directory


## How to browse GitHub
    - download and run Jupyter notebook files
