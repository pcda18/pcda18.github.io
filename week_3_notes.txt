# PCDA week 3 plans


## Let’s go around for a minute and talk a bit about our computers.

Where’d you get your laptop, how old is it?

 - or -

Tell us about your first computer.


Part of hacker culture is the lore — what’s been done, who’s famous. Like graffiti artists or any other culture.


## Group question

Talk about your first computer.


### Demo

Demo: using an API to grab some JSON records.

## Slow walkthrough

- Transferring (w/ filtering) from one list to another with a for loop.

- List comprehensions — doing it in 1 line, very Pythonic

- Pick an api from a list and start exploring the tree to find a given field. Make a list of titles/urls/etc.


## Dictionaries

- A given key can point to numbers, text strings, lists, dictionaries, whatever.

- Point: Dictionaries and JSON objects are basically the same thing.

- Make a list of PDFs linked on a page and download them all, pausing between each.
