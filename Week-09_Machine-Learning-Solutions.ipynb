      "I had very early made the acquaintance of Lemsford.\n",
      "\n",
      "As may readily be imagined, the business of writing verse is a very different thing on the gun-deck of a frigate, from what the gentle and sequestered Wordsworth found it at placid Rydal Mount in Westmoreland.\n",

      "--\"He's got a fit, hain't he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Often he read over his effusions to me; and well worth the hearing they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had wit, imagination, feeling, and humour in abundance; and out of the very ridicule with which some persons regarded him, he made rare metrical sport, which we two together enjoyed by ourselves; or shared with certain select friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "And upon my word, noble Jack, with his native-born good sense, taste, and humanity, was not ill qualified to play the true part of a _Quarterly Review_;--which is, to give quarter at last, however severe the critique.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Lemsford's great care, anxiety, and endless source of tribulation was the preservation of his manuscripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "This box, of course, he could not keep in his bag or hammock, for, in either case, he would only be able to get at it once in the twenty-four hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was necessary to have it accessible at all times.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when not using it, he was obliged to hide it out of sight, where he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "They hated his box, as if it had been Pandora's, crammed to the very lid with hurricanes and gales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, from this Quoin's vigilance, how could my poor friend the poet hope to escape with his box?\n",
      "\n",
      "and a loud threat, to pitch it overboard the next time, without a moment's warning, or benefit of clergy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, with an inconsolable countenance, he came to me, saying that his casket was nowhere to be found; he had sought for it in his hiding-place, and it was not there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him where he had hidden it?\n",
      "\n",
      "But Quoin knew nothing about it.\n",

      "For ten mortal days the poet was not to be comforted; dividing his leisure time between cursing Quoin and lamenting his loss.\n",

      "The world is undone, he must have thought: no such calamity has befallen it since the Deluge;--my verses are perished.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though Quoin, as it afterward turned out, had indeed found the box, it so happened that he had not destroyed it; which no doubt led Lemsford to infer that a superintending Providence had interposed to preserve to posterity his invaluable casket.\n",
      "\n",
      "As has been seen, Quoin was full of unaccountable whimsies; he was, withal, a very cross, bitter, ill-natured, inflammable old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you will always observe, that the gunner's gang of every man-of-war are invariably ill-tempered, ugly featured, and quarrelsome.\n",

      "The truth seems to be, indeed, that all people should be very careful in selecting their callings and vocations; very careful in seeing to it, that they surround themselves by good-humoured, pleasant-looking objects; and agreeable, temper-soothing sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many an angelic disposition has had its even edge turned, and hacked like a saw; and many a sweet draught of piety has soured on the heart from people's choosing ill-natured employments, and omitting to gather round them good-natured landscapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be advisable for any man, who from an unlucky choice of a profession, which it is too late to change for another, should find his temper souring, to endeavour to counteract that misfortune, by filling his private chamber with amiable, pleasurable sights and sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summer time, an Aeolian harp can be placed in your window at a very trifling expense; a conch-shell might stand on your mantel, to be taken up and held to the ear, that you may be soothed by its continual lulling sound, when you feel the blue fit stealing over you.\n",

      "It should be placed on a bracket in the pier.\n",

      "And when I observed, that nearly all the First Lieutenants I saw in other men-of-war, besides many Second and Third Lieutenants, were similarly lop-sided, I knew that there must be some general law which induced the phenomenon; and I put myself to studying it out, as an interesting problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, I came to the conclusion--to which I still adhere--that their so long wearing only one epaulet (for to only one does their rank entitle them) was the infallible clew to this mystery.\n",

      "My friend Nord was a somewhat remarkable character; and if mystery includes romance, he certainly was a very romantic one.\n",

      "\n",
      "But observing that the only man he ever consorted with was Lemsford, I had too much magnanimity, by going off in a pique at his coldness, to let him lose forever the chance of making so capital an acquaintance as myself.\n",

      "Besides, I saw it in his eye, that the man had been a reader of good books; I would have staked my life on it, that he seized the right meaning of Montaigne.\n",

      "\n",
      "And how he managed to preserve his dignity, as he did, among such a rabble rout was equally a mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "This much was observable, however, that he faithfully discharged whatever special duties devolved upon him; and was so fortunate as never to render himself liable to a reprimand.\n",

      "\n",
      "Is not amputation the only resource, sir?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said Sawyer, \"I am decidedly opposed to it; for if hitherto the patient has not been strong enough to undergo the extraction of the ball, I do not see how he can be expected to endure a far more severe operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "As there is no immediate danger of mortification, and you say the ball cannot be reached without making large incisions, I should support him, I think, for the present, with tonics, and gentle antiphlogistics, locally applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surgeon Patella, of the Algerine,\" said Cuticle, in an ill-suppressed passion, abruptly turning round on the person addressed, \"will _you_ have the kindness to say whether _you_ do not think that amputation is the only resource?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Patella was the youngest of the company, a modest man, filled with a profound reverence for the science of Cuticle, and desirous of gaining his good opinion, yet not wishing to commit himself altogether by a decided reply, though, like Surgeon Sawyer, in his own mind he might have been clearly against the operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What you have remarked, Mr.\n",

      "Still, it is a very critical case, and amputation may be indispensable; and if it is to be performed, there ought to be no delay whatever.\n",

      "That is my view of the case, Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surgeon Patella, then, gentlemen,\" said Cuticle, turning round triumphantly, \"is clearly of opinion that amputation should be immediately performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my own part--individually, I mean, and without respect to the patient--I am sorry to have it so decided.\n",
